## Visualising multiple variables

### Base R

.pull-left-wide[
1. Teach statistical thinking.  
  - Teach statistics as an investigative process of problem-solving and decision making.
  - Give students experience with multivariable thinking [...] to answer challenging questions that require them to investigate and explore relationships among many variables.
1. Focus on conceptual understanding. 
1. Integrate real data with a context and purpose.
1. Foster active learning.
1. **Use technology** to explore concepts and analyse data.
1. Use assessments to improve and evaluate student learning.
