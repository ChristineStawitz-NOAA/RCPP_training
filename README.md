# xaringan templates

NMFS templates to use for xaringan presentations. To use, open one of the template Rmd files and save. Then edit with your material.

### `template.Rmd`. 

This is a basic presentation. [Slides](xaringan-nmfs/docs/template.html)

* The css used is at the top
* `slideNumberFormat:` specifies how to show the slide number
* See the slides for examples of different slide formats

### `template-tufte.Rmd`. 

This is a Tufte presentation. [Slides](xaringan-nmfs/docs/template-tufte.html)

* Uses the Tufte style fonts
* Uses the Tufte line spacings and header styles
* Has a progress bar at the top

### Adapting.

Edit the css files or add new ones. See the `theme` folder for the `xaringan_template.Rmd` that has the code that produces `xaringan-themer.css`. Use that code to create that css file.
